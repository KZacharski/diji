diji config
----------------
This folder has to be in the same directory as the diji binary (or source file in development environments).
You can either move it together with the binary to your projects folder (for example Documents), where you'll create all of your projects or add the diji folder to your path.

You can also replace defaultfav.png with a favicon you want to set as default, like your logo. It can be any png image.
